Prefix American phone numbers from Google contacts with +1

After I moved to Germany, I wanted to prefix the phone numbers of my American contacts
with the +1 country code. Americans have 10-digit phone numbers XXX-XXX-XXXX, but I wanted +1 XXX-XXX-XXXX so that apps like WhatsApp would still automatically fill-in their names from Google contacts when I was not in America.

This small script does that with your Google Contacts .csv file you can download
from https://www.google.com/contacts/. Note that my .csv file was in UTF-16LE
format, which I first converted as follows:

   iconv -f UTF-16LE -t UTF-8 google.csv > google-utf8.csv

Then, run the script:

    go build
    ./google-contacts-phone-prefixer google-utf8.csv > google-utf8-new.csv

And voil√†, google-utf8-new.csv now has all of your contacts who have American
phone numbers with the +1 prefix.

You can upload the resulting .csv back to Google. Make sure to additionally
click "Find and Merge contacts" through the UI. Google will overwrite the old phone numbers with the new ones and things should work fine.
